def rest_week(week, plan_length):

    int -> boolean

    Determine if current week is a rest week.

    Plans work on a 4 week block, with every 4th week being an easier week.
    Runner has at least 2 weeks, and a maximum of 5 weeks before they get an
    easier week.  So if they were on a 6 week plan they would only have an
    easier week on race week.

    Returns True if rest week and False if progression week.
